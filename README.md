# Ramaiah_Skill_Academy_Abhishek_M_RSAGWPESD0115_Assignment_2

## This is the repository of assignment 2 given on 25/10/2024.
## The assignment was based on Matlab and this repository consists of solution to the questions below:

### MATLAB Programming

#### 1 Projectile Trajectory Simulation (lab_pro_1.m)
Develop a MATLAB script that simulates and plots the trajectory of a projectile. Take into account initial velocity, launch angle, and gravitational acceleration. Plot the range and maximum height.

#### 2 Random Number Sequence Generation (lab_pro_2.m)
Write a MATLAB script to generate a sequence of random numbers and plot them as a line graph.

### Simulink
#### 1 RC Circuit Model
Develop a Simulink model for an RC circuit and simulate its response to a step input voltage. Plot the charging and discharging curve of the capacitor and analyze the time constant.

#### 2 Water Tank Temperature Simulation (sl_2.slx)
Create a Simulink model to simulate the temperature change in a water tank as it heats up over time. Use a basic heat source and observe the temperature rise.

### PID Control in MATLAB/Simulink
1. tf=(s3-s+10)/(s4+3s^2-20) (cnt_1.slx)
2. tf=(s3+2s^2+s+10)/(s4+3s-20) (cnt_2.slx)
